Friend or Foe
=============

Requires
--------
- deck of 52 playing cards
- 3 x six-sided die (or 1 thrown 3 times)
- 2-4 players
- pen & paper to note score

Preparation
-----------
Each player chooses and ace as their playing piece. If there are fewer than four players, discard the unused suits if you want a shorter game.

Shuffle the remaining cards and lay them face down in a square grid. 

Each player begins at one corner and makes their first move on the corner card.

Play
----

Your ace enters a card and turns it over to discover whose kingdom you have entered. Number cards represent land with villages. Court (picture) cards are the royal houses. Matching suits are friends, others are foes.

If you land on a number card:
- Friend: you can move on to the card and collect the face-value of the card in taxes.
- Foe: you must do battle to see if you collect the taxes: Card values higher than 6 automatically win. Roll a D6 and get higher than or matching the card value to win and collect the card value as tax. If you lose, the tax goes to other player.

All taxes remain in temporary storage until banked in the safety of a royal house.

If you land on a Court card:
- Friend: you can bank your taxes with the royal court. Note these down in a new total.
- Foe: do battle with two D6 where a J=10, Q=11, K=12. Win: Keep taxes but do not bank. Lose: opponent banks your tax.

Every card remains face-up once turned over. You can revisit any card you like. 

On your next turn, you must move to another adjacent card. No diagonal moves.

Each player takes it in turns to move around the board, collecting taxes and banking them. Aa the game progresses the map of the kingdom becomes apparent to all players. 

End Game
--------
When every card of one complete suit is face up, the game ends.

Every player who has their king face up may collect half of their banked taxes as reward.

The winner is the player who has collected the most reward.
