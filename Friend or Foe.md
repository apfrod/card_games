Friend or Foe
=============

Requires
--------
- deck of 52 playing cards
- 2 x six-sided die (or 1 thrown 2 times)
- 2-4 players
- coins, chips or markers to represent money won or lost
- a marker to represent each player

Preparation
-----------
Remove the aces from the deck. Each player chooses and ace as their playing piece. If there are fewer than four players, discard the unused suits if you want a shorter game.

Shuffle the remaining cards and lay them face down in a square grid. When playing with four suits, a 7x7 grid with an empty centre card.

Each player begins in the middle card of one side. Keep your ace next to you to remember your chosen suit and to place winnings.

Play
----
Move your playing piece to enter a card and turn it over to discover whose kingdom you have entered. Number cards represent land with villages. Court (picture) cards are the Royal houses. Matching suits are friends, others are foes.

At every turn you must first move to an empty card (unoccupied by another player) turn it over if it is face down and attempt to collect taxes.

If you land on a number card:
- Friend: you can move on to the card and collect the value of the card in taxes.
- Foe: you must do battle to see if you collect the taxes: Roll two D6 and get higher than or matching the card value to win and collect the tax. If you lose, the tax remains on the card. Place coins or markers to represent the value still available.

Number cards face value 2-6 pay 1 coin of tax. 7-10 are worth 3 coins. Royal house cards are worth 5 coins.

All taxes remain in temporary storage until banked in the safety of a Royal house. Place your winnings on your ace.

If you land on a Court card:
- Friend: you can bank your taxes with the Royal Court. Place the amount you wish to bank to one side of your ace.
- Foe: do battle with two D6 where a J=10, Q=11, K=12.
-- Win: Keep your taxes but do not bank. Win any coins currently on the Royal card.
-- Lose: the Royal card takes all the un-banked tax you currently have placed on your ace. Place it on the Royal card.

You can spend up to 3 un-banked coins to add 1 to a dice roll. Additionally, you get +1 for each Royal card of your suit that is face up. So the maximum is +6 to each battle. Spent coins go back into the box.

Every card remains face-up once turned over. You can revisit any card you like.

On your next turn, you must move to another adjacent card. No diagonal moves.

Each player takes it in turns to move around the board, collecting taxes and banking them. As the game progresses the map of the kingdom becomes apparent to all players.


End Game
--------
When every card is face up, the game ends.

The winner is the player who has collected the most total coins.


Things to Remember
------------------
You must still battle enemy Royal cards even when they are bankrupt, so careful where you move.

Royal cards are hard to beat and will take all your coins, so you may as well pay as much as you can to improve your chances.
